     * <p>
     *     The LRA model guarantees eventual consistency but does not say when
     *     participants will be brought into a consistent state, for example an
     *     implementation may not notify participants immediately when an LRA
     *     is closed or cancelled.
     *
     *     To support implementations that do not immediately attempt to notify
     *     participants the TCK needs to know how long to delay before checking whether
     *     or not the implementation called them.
     *     This delay will depend on the particular implementation so it is
     *     configurable, i.e, use this property to configure the number of
     *     milliseconds that a test will wait for before it checks if a complete
     *     or compensate method has been called.
     *
     *     There are two properties for configuring delays. The long version should be
     *     used when multiple calls to these participant methods needs to be performed.
     *
     *     The default is set to zero which implies that the implementation will
     *     notify participants as soon as the LRA enters the
     *     {@link LRAStatus#Closing} or {@link LRAStatus#Cancelling}
     *     states. Note that this does not imply that the participant will
     *     complete or compensate immediately since it may enter the
     *     {@link ParticipantStatus#Completing} or {@link ParticipantStatus#Compensating}
     *     states first if a participant cannot clean up or compensate immediately.
